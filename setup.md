## LangChain Setup Guide: A Python & Streamlit Project

Welcome to the setup guide for the LangChain project. This step-by-step guide will walk you through the entire process to ensure a seamless experience in building your chatbot application.

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.7+** installed on your machine. You can download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. Familiarity with basic Python programming and virtual environments.

### Steps

#### 1. **Clone the Repository**

First, you need to clone the GitHub repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone [repository-link]
cd [repository-name]
```

Replace `[repository-link]` with the actual link and `[repository-name]` with the name of the cloned repository.

#### 2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

To avoid any package conflicts, it's a good practice to set up a virtual environment.

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Activate the virtual environment
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

#### 3. **Install Required Packages**

Now, install all the necessary packages using the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository.

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. **Huggingface API Key (Optional)**

If you intend to use models from Huggingface, ensure you have an API key. Store it safely.

#### 5. **Configure Streamlit and ChatGPT API**

Replace the placeholders in the configuration files with your specific API keys and any other specific details as required.

#### 6. **Run the Streamlit App**

Now, it's time to experience the magic!

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

The application should open up in your default web browser.

#### 7. **Upload your PDFs and Enjoy**

Navigate to the appropriate section in the Streamlit app, upload your PDFs, and start querying the chatbot!

### Troubleshooting

1. **Dependencies Issues**: Ensure you're using the right Python version and have activated your virtual environment.
2. **API Key Errors**: Double-check your API keys and ensure they are correctly placed in the configuration files.
3. **PDF Upload Errors**: Make sure the PDFs are not corrupted and are accessible for reading.

### Conclusion

Setting up the LangChain project should now be a breeze. Dive deep into the world of AI and experience the power of LangChain combined with ChatGPT API in Python.

For any further queries or issues, refer to the GitHub repository's issues section or reach out directly.

Happy coding!
